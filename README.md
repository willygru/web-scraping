# SIMPLE WEB SCRAPER

## Description
This project is a simple web scraper designed to extract job posting data from Indeed.com. The data extracted by the web scraper is saved and structured using Pandas, a data analysis and manipulation library in Python. 

The web scraper works by navigating the site, searching for specific job postings, extracting the relevant data, and saving it in an easy-to-read and -analyze format.

Please note that this project is primarily for demonstrative purposes and should not be used to scrape large amounts of data without permission.
