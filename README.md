# Simple Web Scraper

## Description
This project, a simple web scraper, is designed to extract job posting data from Indeed.com. It saves and structures the data using Pandas, a Python library renowned for its data analysis and manipulation capabilities.

The web scraper operates by navigating the website, identifying specific job postings, extracting the associated data, and saving it in a format that's straightforward to read and analyze.

This is the second iteration of the project. Although a previous version was developed years ago, it was never published. This version represents an enhanced, polished and more efficient version of the original concept.

Please note: This project is primarily for demonstrative purposes. It's recommended not to use it for scraping large volumes of data without obtaining the necessary permissions first.
